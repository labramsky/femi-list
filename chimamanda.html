            Chimamanda is the award-winning author of the novels <i>Purple Hibiscus</i> (2003), <i>Half of a Yellow Sun</i> (2006), and <i>Americanah</i> (2013), the short story collection <i>The Thing Around Your Neck</i> (2009), and the book-length essay <i>We Should All Be Feminists</i> (2014). Her work has been translated into over thirty languages and she has been invited to speak around the world.

            In her 2009 TED Talk, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story?language=en"><i>The Danger of A Single Story</i></a>, Chimamanda warns that if we only hear a single story about another person or country, the consequence is creating stereotypes that flatten and misjudge people. With over 19 million views, it is one of the most-viewed TED Talks of all time.

          <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc">
              <p>I am angry. Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice. We should all be angry. Anger has a long history bringing about positive change, but in addition to being angry I am also hopeful. Because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better.</p>

          <p>
            In 2012, Chimamanda spoke about her feminist journey at TEDxEuston and later published a book with her speech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc"><i>We Should All Be Feminists</i></a>. She discusses her own experiences as a feminist, going in depth on gender and how we must raise children differently. She explains, "Gender prescribes how we should be, rather than recognizing who we are."
          </p>
          <p>
            There's been an overwhelmingly positive response to Chimamanda's essay. In particular, Sweden — <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2018/shareable-infographics/">the third most gender equal country in the world</a> — launched an initiative to give a copy to every 16-year-old student in the country. Beyoncé also featured <i>We Should All Be Feminists</i> in her 2013 song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyuUWOnS9BY"><i>Flawless</i></a>.
