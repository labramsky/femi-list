            Frida is one of Mexico’s greatest artists, celebrated for her depictions of Mexican culture and explorations of her own physical and emotional pain. Frida created over 50 self-portraits of her life experiences and her tumultuous relationship with her twice-husband, artist Diego Rivera.

            After a horrible bus accident when she was 18 years old in 1925, Frida’s spine and pelvis were shattered. Frida then began painting during her recovery. Her self-portrait showing the accident, <a href="https://www.fridakahlo.org/self-portrait-with-cropped-hair.jsp"><i>The Broken Column</i></a>, portrays her suffering and anguish, as well as her strength and triumph.

            Frida’s relationship with her husband was turbulent and filled with passion. After her separation from her husband, her self-portrait <a href="https://www.fridakahlo.org/self-portrait-with-cropped-hair.jsp"><i>Self-Portrait With Cropped Hair</i></a>, shows Frida in a suit with her long hair cut off. Her work expresses her rejection of the norms of feminine appearance and her longing for independence.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Frida’s death in 1954, the feminist movement of the 1970’s brought a revival of Frida’s work, celebrating her as a boundary-pushing icon of feminism. Along with her work, Frida’s appearance has made a lasting impact on the world. <a href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/porter/article-633ccbb7977517f1/lifestyle/culture/frida-kahlo">Frida’s unibrow remains incredibly important</a>, as her visual identity challenges social constructs of beauty norms that still exist today.
