            Serena has always been interested in fashion, collaborating with Nike and the Home Shopping Network to endorse products. In 2015, Serena was the first black female athlete to land a <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-april-cover-caroline-wozniacki?verso=true">solo cover of <i>Vogue</i></a>. And on top of that, in a 2018 edition of <i>Vogue</i>, Serena shared the major health complications related to giving birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia, as well as how motherhood is making her a better player. Serena relased her own clothing line in 2018, <a href="https://www.serenawilliams.com/"><i>'S' by Serena</i></a>, which aims to empower, celebrate, and champion women.

          <p>
            Serena continues to advocate for gender equality. During the US Open in 2018, the umpire gave Selena a warning for receiving coaching from the sidelines and docked her a point for smashing her racket. The umpire then penalised her a game. Following the match, a cartoon appeared in the Australian newspaper <i>Herald Sun</i>, illustrating Serena having a tantrum on the court. The cartoon was widely criticized as being racist and sexist. In the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1038558762376679425">interview following the match</a>, Serena expressed that she’s fighting for women’s rights and called out the sexist double standards.
